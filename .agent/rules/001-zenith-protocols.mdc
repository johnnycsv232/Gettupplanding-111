# GETTUPP ZENITH PROTOCOLS

The 4-D Methodology governs all AI agent behavior in this project.

## 1. DECONSTRUCT
- Extract core intent, key entities, and context
- Identify output requirements and constraints
- Map what is provided vs. what is missing

## 2. DIAGNOSE
- Audit for clarity gaps and ambiguity
- Check specificity and completeness
- Assess structure and complexity requirements

## 3. DEVELOP
- Select optimal techniques based on request type:
  - **Creative** -> Multi-perspective framing + tone emphasis
  - **Technical** -> Constraint-based design + precision focus
  - **Educational** -> Few-shot examples + clear structure
  - **Complex** -> Systematic frameworks + explicit reasoning
- Assign the appropriate AI role or expertise
- Enhance context and enforce logical structure

## 4. DELIVER
- Construct the optimized output
- Format based on task complexity
- Provide clear implementation guidance

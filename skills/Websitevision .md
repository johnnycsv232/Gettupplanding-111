WHO'S BEHIND THIS
Johnny — Founder, GETTUPP ENT
I've been in the rooms.
Behind the decks.
At the bar at 2 AM when the energy peaks and nobody's capturing it.
GETTUPP ENT — Website Spec (Final) 15
I started GETTUPP because I got tired of watching venues post blurry phone clips
on Tuesday... for a Saturday night.
This isn't an agency.
It's one person who shows up, shoots fast, and delivers content you'll actually
use.
No account managers.
No bloated teams.
No excuses.
Just me, a camera, and a 72-hour turnaround.
Location:
📍 Based in Minneapolis. Shooting where the energy is.

Same nights you're already shooting. That's leverage.
HARD RULE
If an add-on:
Requires more on-site time
Requires live meetings
Requires "thinking on the fly"
It's not an add-on. It's a new product.
And new products kill focus.

# AGENT_LOG.md

## 2026-02-02 21:07 (Session Start)

- **Objective**: Continue from Step 32 of the Master Task List.
- **Context**: Resuming after model switch. `AGENT_LOG.md` was missing, created to restore protocol compliance.
- **Status**:
  - Step 31 (CSS/Tailwind Audit) complete.
  - Step 32 (Bundle Analysis) in progress. Webpack build success (Exit 0), `client.html` generated in `.next/analyze`.
  - Step 33 (Freeze Core Architecture) complete. Documentation updated to Next.js 16 + Turbopack.

## Current Plan

1. Resolve bundle analysis failure by using native Next.js 15/16 experimental analyze mode.
2. Review bundle sizes for Step 32.
3. Documentation walk-through for Step 33.

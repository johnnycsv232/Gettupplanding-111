# AGENT_LOG.md

## 2026-02-02 21:07 (Session Start)

- **Objective**: Continue from Step 32 of the Master Task List.
- **Context**: Resuming after model switch. `AGENT_LOG.md` was missing, created to restore protocol compliance.
  - Step 32 (Bundle Analysis) complete. Reports reviewed: client.html (730KB gzipped).
  - Step 33 (Freeze Core Architecture) complete.
  - Dependency Audit: Resolved high-severity `fast-xml-parser` vulnerability via `overrides` in `package.json`.

## Current Plan

1. Review and confirm work with user.
2. Proceed with Steps 37-40 of the Master Task List.

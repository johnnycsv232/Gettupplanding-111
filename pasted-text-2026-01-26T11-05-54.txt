I can see you want me to continue efficiently from where the previous session left off. Looking at the context, you were in the middle of setting up:

1. **Google Stitch skills** ✅ (partially done)
2. **IDE configurations** (in progress)
3. **Docker decision** (needs evaluation)
4. **Ghost code cleanup** (pending)
5. **Final optimization** (pending)

Let me continue efficiently by completing the remaining tasks:Good! I can see the IDE folders are already created. Let me quickly verify the Stitch skills installation and then finish the remaining tasks:Perfect! Stitch skills are installed (stitch-design-md, stitch-loop, stitch-react-components). Now let me complete the remaining tasks efficiently by creating a comprehensive setup script:Now let me create comprehensive IDE rules files:Now create unified rules for all AI IDEs:Now copy the settings to other IDEs:Now let me create a **Docker decision document** and check for ghost code:Now let me scan for ghost code:Good, I can see the components. The previous session mentioned these were potentially unused. Let me check if they're actually imported:I can see that only Hero and Pricing are used. Let me check all the landing components and move unused ones:Let me create a comprehensive ghost code cleanup script:Now let me create a **comprehensive setup verification script** and a README for smooth IDE startup:Finally, let me create a **master verification script** that runs on startup:Now let me update the package.json to add helpful scripts:Perfect! Now let me create one final comprehensive summary document:Perfect! Now let me create a quick visual summary:Excellent! Now let me verify everything one final time and create a summary:Perfect! Everything is in place. Now let me create a final comprehensive summary for you:

# MASTER SKILL ORCHESTRATION PROTOCOL

This rule governs how agents select, compose, and execute skills from the skills/ directory.

## 1. AUTOMATIC DISCOVERY HIERARCHY

When receiving a task, the agent MUST perform a recursive scan following this priority:

1. **Thematic Category**: Look into _ prefixed folders matching the task domain (e.g., _core, _frontend)
2. **Specific Trigger**: Identify skills with matching description or metadata
3. **Composite Match**: For multi-component tasks, select multiple skills for orchestration

## 2. THE DIRECTOR PATTERN

For complex objectives, initiate a **Composition Chain**:

- **Step 1 (Plan)**: Use @senior-architect or @planning-with-files
- **Step 2 (Execute)**: Chain domain skills (e.g., @nextjs-best-practices -> @three-js-expert)
- **Step 3 (Verify)**: Use @systematic-debugging or @playwright-skill

## 3. SELECTION CRITERIA

- **Specificity**: Prefer @stripe-integration over general @backend-dev-guidelines
- **Recency**: Use skills updated in _REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
- **Anti-Redundancy**: Never use two skills for the same atomic task

## 4. EXECUTION INVARIANTS

- **Pre-execution Check**: Explicitly mention which skills are being invoked before writing code
- **Context Injection**: Each skill's SKILL.md takes precedence over general prompts for that sub-task

> Failure to invoke at least one specialized skill for any non-trivial code change is a violation of the GETTUPP ZENITH PROTOCOLS.

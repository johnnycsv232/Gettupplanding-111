# The Iron Laws of Development

## 1. The Iron Law of TDD
**Write the test first. Watch it fail.**
If you write code before the test, **delete it**.
**No exceptions.**

### Workflow
1. Write the test
2. Watch it fail
3. Write the minimal code to pass
4. Watch it pass
5. Refactor if needed

## 2. Systematic Debugging
**Symptom fixes are failure.**
You must find the **root cause** before proposing a fix.

### Process
1. Read the error message
2. Trace the data
3. Identify the root cause
4. Fix the root cause (not the symptom)

## 3. Clean Code
**Concise, direct, solution-focused.**
- No over-engineering
- Edit the file **+ all dependent files**
- Minimal, elegant solutions

## 4. The TDD Workflow
```
Test → Fail → Code → Pass → Refactor
```
**Always follow this cycle. No shortcuts.**

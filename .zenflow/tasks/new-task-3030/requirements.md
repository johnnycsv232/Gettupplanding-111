## 1. Product Vision & Target Aesthetic

### 1.1 Brand Positioning
- **Market:** Premium nightlife content production (Minneapolis-focused, nationally scalable)
- **Target Audience:** Venue owners, event promoters, brand managers, influencers
- **Unique Value Proposition:** "Own the Night" - 24-hour delivery, Cinema-grade post-production, proven ROI (79.7K views in 90 days)

### 1.2 Visual Design Philosophy: "Liquid Glass 2.0"

The site must evoke **exclusivity, high-end production quality, and immediate trustworthiness** through:

1. **Glassmorphism with Dynamic Lighting**
   - Frosted glass effects with neon inner glows
   - Animated Vegas Gold borders that "breathe"
   - Radial gradient overlays for depth and focus

2. **Premium Color Palette**
   - **Vegas Gold (#FFC72C)**: Primary CTAs, highlights, conversion elements
   - **Neon Magenta (#FF00FF)**: Brand vertical (GETTUPP GIRLS), pulsing accents
   - **Electric Cyan (#00FFFF)**: Post-production section (CINEMA GRADE), video UI
   - **Deep Void Black (#080808)**: Background for maximum contrast
   - **Off-White (#E0E0E0)**: Body text for readability

3. **Typography**
   - **Headlines:** Bebas Neue / Inter Black (bold, all-caps, subtle gold gradients)
   - **Body:** Inter Regular (clean, highly readable)

4. **Interactive Elements**
   - Three.js particle fields (Vegas Gold particles with mouse parallax)
   - Framer Motion for all transitions (tilts, scales, liquid distortions)
   - Sticky header with sliding CTA
   - Exit-intent "Velvet Rope" email popup

### 1.3 Mobile-First Development Philosophy

**CRITICAL MANDATE: This site must be so stunning on mobile that visitors want to hire us to build their own site.**

**Core Principles:**

1. **Mobile-First Design & Development**
   - Design and develop for mobile screens FIRST (375px - 428px width)
   - Progressive enhancement for tablet (768px+) and desktop (1024px+)
   - Touch-optimized interactions (44px minimum tap targets)
   - Thumb-friendly navigation (bottom-anchored CTAs on mobile)

2. **Performance on Mobile Devices**
   - Three.js particle count: 50 particles on mobile vs. 200 on desktop
   - Video optimization: Serve lower-res video to mobile (720p vs. 1080p desktop)
   - Lazy-load everything below the fold aggressively
   - Target mobile Lighthouse Performance: 95+ (vs. 100 on desktop)

3. **Mobile-Specific Visual Enhancements**
   - **Glassmorphism**: Even more pronounced on mobile (higher blur, stronger glows)
   - **Touch Ripple Effects**: Vegas Gold ripple on button taps (Framer Motion)
   - **Pull-to-Reveal**: Subtle parallax on scroll creates depth
   - **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on CTA taps (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - **Swipe Gestures**: Testimonials carousel, gallery lightbox navigation

4. **Mobile-Optimized Layouts**
   - **Hero Section:** 
     - Full-screen height on mobile (100vh)
     - Larger headline relative to viewport (20vw vs. fixed px)
     - Bottom-anchored CTAs (within thumb reach)
   - **Pricing Cards:**
     - Single-column on mobile, horizontal swipe to view all tiers
     - Current tier centered with prev/next slightly visible (peek effect)
   - **Gallery:**
     - 1-column masonry on mobile (faster render, better visual impact)
     - Instagram Stories-style lightbox (vertical swipe to close)
   - **Forms:**
     - Input fields minimum 48px height
     - Large, easy-to-tap submit buttons (full-width on mobile)

5. **"Wow Factor" Mobile Features**
   - **Tilt on Device Motion**: Use device gyroscope to create parallax (iOS Safari DeviceMotion API)
   - **Ambient Light Adaptation**: Detect ambient light sensor and adjust contrast (if supported)
   - **Install Prompt**: PWA manifest for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
   - **Smooth Scroll Snap**: Sections snap into view on scroll (CSS `scroll-snap-type`)
   - **Lottie Micro-Animations**: Lightweight JSON animations for icons/transitions

6. **Conversion Optimization for Mobile**
   - **Sticky Bottom CTA Bar**: Appears after 2 scrolls, always visible
   - **One-Tap Checkout**: Apple Pay / Google Pay integration with Stripe
   - **Exit-Intent on Mobile**: Trigger on back-button tap (History API)
   - **SMS Opt-In**: Optional phone number capture for "Text me the details"

7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test on real devices: iPhone 12/13/14, Samsung Galaxy S21/S22
   - iOS Safari (primary), Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet
   - Viewport range: 320px (iPhone SE) to 428px (iPhone 14 Pro Max)
   - Portrait AND landscape orientations

**Success Metric:** 
> "When a venue owner pulls up this site on their iPhone while at a bar, they should immediately text their business partner: 'Check this out. We need this.'"

## 2. Core Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Flows

#### Primary Flow: Pilot Conversion
1. User lands on Hero → Impressed by video + particles
2. User scrolls to "THE PILOT" → Glassmorphism card captures attention
3. User clicks "START THE PILOT" CTA → Redirects to Stripe Checkout ($345)
4. Stripe processes payment → Webhook updates Firestore
5. User receives confirmation email with Cal.com booking link
6. User books initial consultation call

#### Secondary Flow: Retainer Conversion
1. User lands on Hero
2. User scrolls through "THE WORK" gallery → Sees quality
3. User reviews "FULL RETAINERS" pricing → Identifies tier
4. User clicks tier CTA → Redirects to Stripe Checkout (subscription)
5. Stripe processes subscription → Webhook updates Firestore
6. User receives onboarding email

#### Tertiary Flow: Lead Capture
1. User explores site without committing
2. **Trigger A**: User moves mouse to exit viewport (exit-intent)
   - OR **Trigger B**: 45 seconds on page (time-delayed)
3. Full-screen modal appears: "THE NIGHT ISN'T OVER"
4. User enters email for "VIP List" + free 5-point audit
5. Email stored in Firestore `leads` collection
6. User receives instant audit delivery email

### 2.2 Technical Integrations

#### 2.2.1 Stripe Payment Processing

**Products to Configure:**
1. **The Pilot** - One-time: $345
2. **Content Audit** - One-time: $300
3. **Essential Retainer** - Subscription: $495/month
4. **Growth Retainer** - Subscription: $695/month (highlight as "BEST VALUE")
5. **Dominate Retainer** - Subscription: $995/month (consultation-only, no direct checkout)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Client-side: Use `@stripe/stripe-js` for checkout redirects
- Server-side: Webhook handler at `/api/webhooks/stripe` (already exists, verify completeness)
- Post-payment: Update Firestore collection `purchases` with:
  ```typescript
  {
    userId: string | null,
    email: string,
    productId: string,
    amount: number,
    status: 'completed' | 'failed',
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    stripeSessionId: string
  }
  ```
- Error handling: Log failed webhooks to Firestore `webhook_errors` collection

#### 2.2.2 Firebase Firestore Schema

**Collections:**

1. **`leads`** (Email captures)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: auto-generated,
     email: string,
     source: 'hero_input' | 'exit_popup',
     city?: string, // Optional from hero input
     timestamp: Timestamp,
     ipAddress?: string, // For spam prevention
     userAgent?: string
   }
   ```

2. **`purchases`** (Stripe successful payments)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: auto-generated,
     email: string,
     productType: 'pilot' | 'audit' | 'retainer',
     productName: string,
     amount: number,
     stripeSessionId: string,
     stripeCustomerId?: string,
     status: 'completed',
     timestamp: Timestamp,
     metadata: Record<string, any>
   }
   ```

3. **`admin_users`** (Whitelisted emails for /admin access)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: auto-generated,
     email: string,
     role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'viewer',
     createdAt: Timestamp
   }
   ```

**Security Rules:**
- `leads`: Write-only for client, read for authenticated admins
- `purchases`: Server-only writes (via webhook), read for authenticated admins
- `admin_users`: Read-only for authenticated users (to verify own access)

#### 2.2.3 Sanity CMS Integration

**Schema Requirements:**

1. **`galleryItem`** (Portfolio pieces for "THE WORK" section)
   ```typescript
   {
     _id: string,
     title: string,
     mediaType: 'video' | 'photo',
     thumbnailUrl: string,
     fullMediaUrl: string,
     category: string[], // For filtering (e.g., ["events", "portraits"])
     order: number, // For manual sorting
     publishedAt: datetime,
     featured: boolean
   }
   ```

2. **`testimonial`**
   ```typescript
   {
     _id: string,
     clientName: string,
     clientRole?: string,
     platform: 'instagram' | 'tiktok' | 'google',
     quote: text,
     rating?: number,
     avatarUrl?: string,
     publishedAt: datetime
   }
   ```

**API Implementation:**
- Client-side data fetching using `@sanity/client`
- Cache strategy: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) with 60-second revalidation
- Fallback: Show placeholder skeleton UI if Sanity is unreachable

#### 2.2.4 Cal.com Booking Integration

**Requirements:**
- Embed Cal.com scheduling widget on `/book` page (post-Pilot purchase)
- Pass user email from Stripe webhook to pre-fill booking form
- Configuration: Use Cal.com embed script with custom styling to match Liquid Glass theme

- CTAs: 
  - Primary: "START $345 PILOT" (Vegas Gold button)
  - Secondary: "VIEW THE WORK" (Ghost button, scrolls to gallery)

**Visual Elements:**
1. **Background:** Looping video (muted, autoplay, lazy-loaded)
   - Overlay: Radial gradient (Deep Void Black center → transparent edges)
2. **Three.js Particle Field:**
   - 200 Vegas Gold particles (#FFC72C with 30% opacity)
   - Slow drift motion (vertical rise + horizontal sway)
   - Mouse parallax: Particles shift 20px in direction of cursor
   - Performance: Use `THREE.Points` with instanced geometry

**Interactions:**

- City input: On submit, validate email format (Zod), store to Firestore, show success toast

**Performance:**
- Video: Use `<video>` tag with `preload="metadata"`, `muted`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `playsinline`
- Three.js: Lazy-load using `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`
- Target LCP: < 2.5s (hero image/video must load fast)

**Mobile-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Layout (Mobile: 375px - 428px):**
   - Full-screen height: `100vh` (fills entire mobile screen)
   - Headline: Responsive sizing `clamp(2.5rem, 8vw, 4rem)` instead of fixed px
   - CTAs: Bottom-anchored (60px from bottom, within thumb reach)
   - City input: Full-width with 48px height minimum

   - Video source: Serve 720p MP4 on mobile (vs. 1080p desktop) using `<source media="(max-width: 768px)">`
   - Poster image: Show high-quality still image while video loads
   - Reduce blur radius: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` on mobile (vs. 30px desktop) for faster render

3. **Mobile-Specific Interactions:**
   - **Device Gyroscope Parallax:** Use DeviceMotion API to tilt particles based on phone orientation
     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', (e) => {
       // Tilt particles based on beta/gamma values
     });
     ```
   - **Touch Ripple:** Vegas Gold ripple effect on CTA button tap (Framer Motion)
   - **Haptic Feedback:** Vibrate on CTA tap (50ms pulse)
     ```javascript
     if (navigator.vibrate) navigator.vibrate(50);
     ```
   - **Pull-to-Refresh Disable:** Prevent native pull-to-refresh from interfering with scroll

- Implement breathing animation with CSS keyframes or Framer Motion loop

**Mobile-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Horizontal Swipe Carousel:**
   - Layout: Single-column, horizontal scroll with snap points
   - CSS: `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` for card snapping
   - Current card: Centered with 20% of adjacent cards visible (peek effect)
   - Swipe gesture: Drag to navigate, momentum scrolling enabled

### 3.8 The Work (Gallery)
**Purpose:** Social proof through portfolio

**Content:**
- Headline: "THE WORK"
- Filter Tabs: ALL | VIDEO | PHOTO
- Masonry Grid: Fetch from Sanity CMS
  - Each item: Thumbnail with play icon (videos) or overlay (photos)
  - Click: Open lightbox with full media

**Visual:**
- Masonry layout (use CSS Grid or library like `react-masonry-css`)
- Dark metallic border around each item
- Liquid transition: On filter change, grid items morph with smooth, liquid-like distortion

**Interactions:**
1. Filter change:
   - Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` for item exit/enter
   - Liquid distortion: Use Framer Motion's `layoutId` + custom transition
2. Item hover:
   - Scale up (1.05x)
   - Subtle drop shadow appears
3. Lightbox:
   - Full-screen overlay (Deep Void Black 90% opacity)
   - Navigation arrows (prev/next)
   - Close button (top-right)

**Technical:**
- Fetch data from Sanity using `@sanity/client`
- ISR revalidation: 60 seconds
- Lazy-load images below the fold using `next/image` with `loading="lazy"`
- Videos: Use `<video>` tag with `controls`, load on lightbox open only

**Performance:**
- Thumbnail optimization: Next.js Image with `width={400}` and `quality={80}`
- Infinite scroll (optional): Load more items as user scrolls (reduces initial load)

**Mobile-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Layout:**
   - 1-column masonry grid (full-width images, stacked vertically)
   - Filter tabs: Horizontal scroll with sticky positioning
   - Tab indicators: Underline animation on active tab
   - Spacing: 8px gap between images (vs. 16px desktop)

2. **Instagram Stories-Style Lightbox:**
   - Full-screen vertical layout (no chrome, just media + close button)
   - Swipe gestures:
     - Swipe left/right: Navigate to prev/next item
     - Swipe down: Close lightbox (with momentum animation)
     - Swipe up: Share (if implemented)
   - Progress indicators: Small dots at top showing position in gallery
   - Auto-advance: Optional 5-second timer for videos (like IG Stories)

3. **Touch Interactions:**
   - Tap image: Open lightbox immediately (no hover state)
   - Double-tap: Zoom in/out (pinch-to-zoom also supported)
   - Long-press: Share menu (native share dialog)
   - Haptic feedback: Subtle pulse (20ms) on image tap

4. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Render only 10 images initially, load more on scroll
   - Use low-quality placeholder (LQIP) while high-res loads
   - Videos: Load thumbnail only, defer video load until lightbox opens
   - Intersection Observer: Pause off-screen videos to save battery

5. **Visual Enhancements:**
   - Image borders: Thinner (1px vs. 2px desktop) to maximize screen space
   - Play icon overlay: Larger (64px vs. 48px) for easier tapping on videos
   - Filter tabs: Bottom-anchored on mobile (easier thumb access)

**Desktop vs. Mobile Layout:**

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Grid Columns | 3-4 columns (masonry) | 1 column (vertical stack) |
| Image Gap | 16px | 8px |
| Lightbox Navigation | Arrow buttons | Swipe gestures |
| Lightbox Close | X button (top-right) | Swipe down or X button |
| Filter Tabs | Top-anchored | Bottom-anchored (sticky) |
| Initial Load | 20 images | 10 images |

## 4. Conversion Optimization Features

### 4.1 Exit-Intent "Velvet Rope" Popup

**Triggers:**
1. **Exit-Intent**: User moves mouse out of viewport (top edge)
2. **Time-Delayed**: 45 seconds on page (fallback if no exit-intent)

**Content:**
- Headline: "THE NIGHT ISN'T OVER"
- Subheadline: "Join the VIP List for exclusive content, early access, and a free 5-point audit delivered instantly."
- Email Input: "Enter your email"
- CTA: "JOIN THE VIP LIST" (Vegas Gold)
- Close: "X" button (top-right)

**Visual:**
- Full-screen modal (z-index: 10000)
- Background: Deep Void Black with 90% opacity, blurred backdrop
- Central card: Glassmorphism with Vegas Gold glow
- Form: Vegas Gold focus states

**Interactions:**
1. On trigger:
   - Fade-in background (300ms)
   - Scale-in card (500ms, ease-out)
2. On submit:
   - Validate email (Zod)
   - Store to Firestore `leads` collection
   - Show success toast: "Check your inbox for your free audit!"
   - Close modal
3. On close:
   - Set localStorage flag: `vip_popup_dismissed=true` (don't show again for 30 days)

**Technical:**
- Exit-intent: Listen for `mouseleave` event on `document` with `clientY < 10`
- Time-delayed: `setTimeout` for 45,000ms
- Prevent re-trigger: Check `localStorage` before showing
- Firestore write: Use client SDK with security rules allowing writes to `leads`

**Mobile-Specific Requirements:**

1. **Alternative Trigger for Mobile:**
   - **Exit-intent doesn't work on mobile** (no mouse cursor)
   - Mobile triggers:
     - **Back Button Tap:** Intercept browser back button using History API
       ```javascript
       window.history.pushState(null, '', window.location.href);
       window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
         // Show popup instead of navigating back
         showVIPPopup();
         // Push state again to keep user on page
         window.history.pushState(null, '', window.location.href);
       });
       ```
     - **Time-Delayed:** 30 seconds on mobile (vs. 45s desktop) - shorter attention span
     - **Scroll-to-Bottom:** Trigger when user scrolls past 80% of page

2. **Mobile Layout Adjustments:**
   - Modal: Full-screen on mobile (100vw × 100vh), no background blur (performance)
   - Card: Centered vertically with more padding (24px vs. 40px desktop)
   - Headline: Smaller font size (32px vs. 48px)
   - Email input: Full-width (90vw), 56px height (easy thumb tap)
   - Close button: Larger (48px × 48px) and positioned bottom-left (thumb reach)

3. **Touch Interactions:**
   - Tap outside modal: Close popup (same as desktop)
   - Swipe down on modal: Close with momentum animation
   - Email input: Auto-focus with keyboard slide-up (use `autoFocus` prop)
   - CTA button: Touch ripple effect with haptic feedback (50ms pulse)

4. **Performance:**
   - Background: Solid color (Deep Void Black 95% opacity) instead of blurred backdrop
   - Animation: Reduce blur effects (too CPU-intensive on mobile)
   - Modal rendering: Use React Portal to prevent layout shifts

5. **Conversion Optimization:**
   - Pre-fill email: If user already entered city in Hero, pre-fill email input
   - One-tap submit: `enterkeyhint="send"` on input for quick submission
   - Social proof: Add small text below CTA: "Join 2,000+ VIP members"

**Desktop vs. Mobile Comparison:**

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Trigger | Exit-intent (mouse) | Back button + time-delay + scroll-to-bottom |
| Time-Delay | 45 seconds | 30 seconds |
| Background | Blurred backdrop | Solid color (performance) |
| Modal Size | Centered card (600px) | Full-screen |
| Close Button | Top-right (32px) | Bottom-left (48px, thumb reach) |
| Input Height | 48px | 56px |

### 4.2 Hero City Input Lead Capture

**Functionality:**
1. User enters city name
2. On submit:
   - Validate input (non-empty string)
   - Store to Firestore `leads` collection with `source: 'hero_input'`
   - Smooth scroll to "THE WORK" gallery section
   - Show toast: "Welcome to the family! Check out our {city} work below."

**Technical:**
- Form submit handler
- Firestore write (client SDK)
- Smooth scroll: Use `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`

### 4.3 Sticky Header CTA

**Purpose:** Always-visible conversion anchor

**Functionality:**
- "START THE PILOT" button visible in header at all times (except on mobile below 500px scroll)
- On scroll down (>100px): Button slides in from right
- On scroll up: Button remains visible
- Click: Redirect to Stripe Checkout

**Technical:**
- Scroll detection: Framer Motion `useScroll` or vanilla JS `window.scrollY`
- Animation: Framer Motion `motion.button` with `animate` prop

## 7. Development Methodology & Skills Integration

### 7.1 Component-First Approach (Stitch-Inspired)

**Principles:**
1. **Modular Development**: Build each of the 16 sections as a standalone component
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Implement → Test → Refine → Move to next section
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Reuse component patterns (e.g., glassmorphism card, CTA button)
4. **Design System**: Create Tailwind config with custom tokens (Vegas Gold, Neon Magenta, etc.)

**Execution:**
- Create components in `src/features/landing/components/v2/` (to avoid conflicts with existing)
- Each component: TypeScript, Zod props validation, Framer Motion animations
- Storybook (optional): Visual testing for each component

### 7.2 Multi-Skill Development Directive

- 100% coverage for critical paths (payment, lead capture)

---

## 8. Migration Plan from Current State

### 8.1 Current vs. Target State

**Current:**
- CSS Modules (Landing.module.css, Pricing.module.css)
- Partial component implementation (Hero, Founder, Pricing, etc.)
- Using Inter/Outfit fonts
- Basic glassmorphism in CSS variables

**Target:**
- Tailwind CSS (custom config with Vegas Gold, Neon Magenta, Electric Cyan)
- Complete 16-section architecture
- Bebas Neue / Inter Black for headlines
- Advanced glassmorphism with Framer Motion

### 8.2 Migration Approach

**Option A: Full Rewrite (Recommended)**
- Preserve existing components as `src/features/landing/components/v1/`
- Build new components in `src/features/landing/components/v2/`
- Gradually replace sections in main page
- Benefits: Clean slate, no technical debt

**Option B: Incremental Migration**
- Convert CSS Module classes to Tailwind utilities
- Refactor existing components to match new design
- Risk: May introduce inconsistencies

**Decision:** **Option A (Full Rewrite)** to ensure Liquid Glass 2.0 aesthetic is achieved without compromise.

### 8.3 Tailwind Configuration

**Setup:**
1. Install Tailwind CSS:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. Create `tailwind.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

   const config: Config = {
     content: [
       './src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './src/features/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           'vegas-gold': '#FFC72C',
           'neon-magenta': '#FF00FF',
           'electric-cyan': '#00FFFF',
           'deep-void': '#080808',
           'off-white': '#E0E0E0',
         },
         fontFamily: {
           'bebas': ['Bebas Neue', 'sans-serif'],
           'inter': ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
         },
         backdropBlur: {
           'glass': '30px',
         },
         boxShadow: {
           'glass': '0 0 20px rgba(255, 199, 44, 0.4)',
           'neon-magenta': 'inset 0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.3)',
         },
       },
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   export default config;
   ```

3. Update `src/app/globals.css`:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

   @layer base {
     body {
       @apply bg-deep-void text-off-white;
     }
   }

   @layer components {
     .glass {
       @apply bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-glass border border-white/10;
     }
   }
   ```

## 12. Assumptions & Open Questions

### 12.1 Assumptions

1. **Brand Assets:**
   - ✅ Founder image provided (johnny_cage.png.jpg)
   - Assumption: Additional images needed (logo, client logos, event photos) will be provided or sourced

2. **Content:**
   - Assumption: Final copy for all sections will be provided or can be inferred from existing spec
   - Assumption: Testimonial content will be real (not lorem ipsum)

3. **Business Logic:**
   - Assumption: Stripe products will be created manually in Stripe Dashboard
   - Assumption: Dominate Retainer is consultation-only (no auto-checkout)

4. **Legal:**
   - Assumption: Privacy Policy and Terms of Service will be provided as separate pages or external links

### 12.2 Open Questions (ANSWERED)

1. **Domain & Hosting:**
   - ✅ **Domain:** Free Vercel domain for now (e.g., `gettuppent.vercel.app`)
   - ✅ **Vercel:** Will configure during deployment

2. **Brand Assets:**
   - ✅ **Logo:** Will create placeholder or use text-based logo for now
   - ✅ **Client Logos:** Has real logos but use placeholders for testing
   - ✅ **Event Photos/Videos:** Has real content but use placeholders for testing

3. **Content:**
   - ✅ **Founder Name:** Mpls Johnny Cage (@mplsjohnnycage)
   - ✅ **Testimonials:** Will use generic ones for launch, replace with real later

4. **Cal.com:**
   - ⏳ **Cal.com URL:** Will configure during implementation (or use contact form fallback)

5. **Email Delivery (ANSWERED - See Section 12.3 for Recommendation):**
   - ✅ **Requirement:** "Most easiest and most automated way"
   - ✅ **Decision:** Resend.com (recommended) or Zapier (alternative)

6. **Analytics:**
   - ✅ **Decision:** Start with Vercel Analytics (built-in, free), add Google Analytics post-launch if needed

7. **A/B Testing:**
   - ✅ **Decision:** Add post-launch (not a launch blocker)

---

### 12.3 Email Automation Recommendation

**RECOMMENDED: Resend.com (Best Balance of Easy + Automated + Free)**

**Why Resend:**
- ✅ **Easiest Developer Experience:** Literally 3 lines of code in Next.js API route
- ✅ **Free Tier:** 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day (more than enough)
- ✅ **Beautiful Templates:** Use React Email for professional-looking audits
- ✅ **Native Next.js Integration:** Built for modern web apps
- ✅ **Deliverability:** High inbox rate, DKIM/SPF built-in
- ✅ **No Monthly Cost:** Free tier covers your needs

**Implementation:**
```bash
npm install resend react-email
```

```typescript
// src/app/api/send-audit/route.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { AuditEmail } from '@/emails/AuditEmail';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { email } = await req.json();
  
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'GETTUPPENT <audit@gettuppent.com>',
    to: email,
    subject: '🎬 Your Free 5-Point Content Audit',
    react: AuditEmail({ recipientEmail: email }),
  });
  
  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```

**Trigger:** When user submits VIP popup email, call this API route → Instant delivery

**Alternative Option: Zapier (No-Code, Slightly More Cost)**
- ✅ **Setup Time:** 5 minutes (no code)
- ✅ **Cost:** $20/month for paid plan (100 tasks/month on free tier)
- ✅ **Flow:** Firestore new document → Send email via Gmail/SendGrid
- ❌ **Drawback:** External dependency, monthly cost

**Decision:** Use **Resend.com** for automated audit delivery.

---

## 13. Out of Scope (Explicitly NOT Included)

1. **Blog/Content Marketing Platform**: This is a landing page only, no blog functionality
2. **User Accounts (Client Portal)**: No login for customers to view their content
3. **Internal Project Management**: No integration with project management tools (Asana, Trello, etc.)
4. **Live Chat**: No live chat widget (can be added post-launch)
5. **Multi-Language Support**: English only for MVP
6. **Mobile App**: Web-only, no native iOS/Android app
7. **Video Hosting**: Videos hosted externally (Sanity, Vimeo, or S3), not self-hosted

## Appendix D: Mobile-First Enhancement Summary

**CRITICAL:** This table serves as the quick reference for all mobile-specific enhancements. Every section must implement these features.

| Section | Mobile Layout | Touch Interactions | Performance Optimization | "Wow Factor" Element |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Hero** | Full-screen (100vh), bottom-anchored CTAs | Device gyroscope parallax, haptic feedback on CTA tap | 50 particles (vs. 200 desktop), 720p video | Particles tilt with phone movement |
| **The Pilot** | Full-width glassmorphism card, larger badge | Tap card to expand, swipe to dismiss | Disable 3D tilt (performance) | Pulsing neon badge more vibrant on mobile |
| **Pricing (Retainers)** | Horizontal swipe carousel with snap points | Swipe to navigate, haptic feedback on snap | Lazy-load off-screen cards | Peek effect (20% of adjacent cards visible) |
| **Gallery** | 1-column vertical stack | Instagram Stories-style swipe (left/right/down to close) | 10 images initial load, LQIP placeholders | Double-tap to zoom, long-press to share |
| **Exit-Intent Popup** | Full-screen modal, bottom-left close button | Back button intercept, swipe down to close | Solid background (no blur) | Pre-fill email if user entered city in Hero |
| **Sticky Header** | Transparent → solid on scroll, hamburger menu | Tap to expand menu, smooth scroll to sections | Hide on scroll down (save screen space) | Slide-in animation for CTA button |
| **Sticky Bottom CTA** | Appears after 2 scrolls, always visible | Haptic feedback on tap, Apple Pay / Google Pay integration | Lightweight bar (no heavy graphics) | Gold glow pulses every 3 seconds |

**Mobile-Specific Technologies:**

| Technology | Purpose | Implementation | Browser Support |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **DeviceMotion API** | Gyroscope parallax for particles | `window.addEventListener('deviceorientation', ...)` | iOS Safari 13+, Chrome Android 80+ |
| **Navigator.vibrate()** | Haptic feedback on CTA taps | `navigator.vibrate([50])` | Chrome Android, iOS Safari (limited) |
| **History API** | Exit-intent via back button intercept | `window.history.pushState()` + `popstate` listener | All modern mobile browsers |
| **CSS scroll-snap** | Smooth carousel snapping | `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` | iOS Safari 11+, Chrome Android 69+ |
| **Intersection Observer** | Lazy-load images, pause off-screen videos | `new IntersectionObserver(...)` | All modern mobile browsers |
| **Apple Pay / Google Pay** | One-tap checkout | Stripe Payment Request Button | iOS Safari, Chrome Android |
| **PWA Manifest** | "Add to Home Screen" prompt | `manifest.json` with icons and theme | All modern mobile browsers |

**Mobile Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Test on real iPhone 12/13/14 (iOS Safari 15+)
- [ ] Test on real Samsung Galaxy S21/S22 (Chrome Android 11+)
- [ ] Test on iPhone SE (smallest screen: 320px width)
- [ ] Test on iPhone 14 Pro Max (largest screen: 428px width)
- [ ] Test portrait orientation (primary)
- [ ] Test landscape orientation (adjust layout gracefully)
- [ ] Test on 4G connection (Chrome DevTools throttling: Fast 3G)
- [ ] Test with low battery mode (iOS) - ensure animations still work
- [ ] Test with reduced motion (accessibility setting) - disable parallax
- [ ] Test form inputs with iOS keyboard (ensure no viewport overlap)
- [ ] Test swipe gestures (pricing, gallery, exit-intent close)
- [ ] Test haptic feedback (vibration on CTA taps)
- [ ] Test back button intercept (exit-intent popup)
- [ ] Test Apple Pay / Google Pay checkout flow
- [ ] Test "Add to Home Screen" PWA prompt

**Mobile Performance Targets:**

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** | < 1.5s | Chrome DevTools Lighthouse (mobile) |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** | < 2.5s | Chrome DevTools Lighthouse (mobile) |
| **First Input Delay (FID)** | < 100ms | Real User Monitoring (RUM) or Lighthouse |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** | < 0.1 | Chrome DevTools Lighthouse (mobile) |
| **Time to Interactive (TTI)** | < 3.5s | Chrome DevTools Lighthouse (mobile) |
| **Total Page Size** | < 2MB | Chrome DevTools Network tab |
| **JavaScript Bundle Size** | < 300KB (gzipped) | Next.js build output |
| **Hero Video Size** | < 3MB (720p mobile) | Video compression tool |

**Mobile-First Development Workflow:**

1. **Design in Figma/Sketch at 375px width first** (iPhone standard size)
2. **Build mobile layout first** using Tailwind mobile-first breakpoints
3. **Test on real device immediately** after each component
4. **Add desktop enhancements** using `md:` and `lg:` Tailwind breakpoints
5. **Optimize for touch** (44px minimum tap targets, swipe gestures)
6. **Test performance on throttled connection** (Fast 3G in Chrome DevTools)
7. **Iterate until mobile experience is flawless** before moving to next component
